    "The most widely used threshold metrics is accuracy:\n",
    "\n",
    " $Accuracy = \\frac{Correct Predictions}{Total Predictions}$     \n",

    "The Failure of Accuracy in imbalance learning context is usually translates in a model with no skill predicting no positive outcomes and still achieving a high accuracy results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most threshold metrics can be best understood by the terms used in a confusion matrix for a binary (two-class) classification problem.  This does not mean that the metrics are limited for use on binary classification; it is just an easy way to quickly understand what is being measured.The confusion matrix provides more insight into not only the performance of a predictive model but also which classes are being predicted correctly, which incorrectly, and what type of errors are being made.  In this type of confusion matrix,  each cell in the table has a specific and well-understood name, summarized as follows:\n",

The score can then be used as a point of comparisonbetween different models on a binary classification problem where a score of 1.0 represents amodel with perfect skill.  The Precision-Recall AUC score can be calculated using the `auc()` function in scikit-learn, taking the precision and recall values as arguments."

On some problems, a crisp class label is not required, and instead a probability of class membership is preferred.  The probability summarizes the likelihood (or uncertainty) of an example belonging to each class label.  Probabilities are more nuanced and can be interpreted by a human operator or a system in decision making.\n",

This focus on predicted probabilities may mean that the crisp class labels predicted by a model are ignored.  This focus may mean that a model that predicts probabilities may appear to have terrible performance when evaluated according to its crisp class labels, such as using accuracy or a similar score.  This is because although the predicted probabilities may show skill, they must be interpreted with a threshold prior to being converted into crisp class labels.\n",

The log loss function calculates the negative log likelihood for probability predictions made by the binary classification model.  Most notably, this is logistic regression,but this function can be used by other models, such as neural networks, and is known by other names,  such as cross-entropy.  Generally,  the log loss can be calculated using the expected probabilities P for each class and the natural logarithm of the predicted probabilities Q for each class:\n",

    "The best possible log loss is 0.0, and values are positive to infinite for progressively worses cores.  If you are just predicting the probability for the positive class, then the log loss function can be calculated for one binary classification prediction (yhat) compared to the expected probability (y) as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    LogLoss =−((1−y)×log(1−yhat) +y×log(yhat))\n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "    LogLoss= −((1−y)×log(1−yhat) +y×log(yhat))\n",

    "\n",
    "The Brier score, named for Glenn Brier, calculates the mean squared error between predicted probabilities and the expected values.  The score summarizes the magnitude of the error in the predicted probabilities and is designed for binary classification problems.  It is focused one valuating the probabilities for the positive class.  Nevertheless, it can be adapted for problems with multiple classes.  It is also an appropriate probabilistic metric for imbalanced classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The evaluation of probabilistic scores is generally performed by means of the BrierScore.  The basic idea is to compute the mean squared error (MSE) between predictedprobability scores and the true class indicator, where the positive class is coded as 1,and negative class 0*— Page 57,Learning from Imbalanced Data Sets, 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Brier scores can become very small and the focus will be on fractions well below the decimal point.  For example, the difference in the above example between Baseline and Perfectscores is slight at four decimal places.  A common practice is to transform the score using a reference score, such as the no skill classifier.  This is called a Brier Skill Score, or BSS, and is calculated as follows:\n",

    "Running the example first calculates the reference Brier score used in the BSS calculation. We can then see that predicting certainty scores for each class results in a negative BSS score,indicating that they are worse than no skill.  Finally, we can see that evaluating the reference forecast itself results in 0.0, indicating no skill and evaluating the true values as predictions results in a perfect score of 1.0.  As such, the Brier Skill Score is a best practice for evaluating probability predictions and is widely used where probability classification prediction are evaluated routinely,such as in weather forecasts (e.g.  rain or not)\n"

    "### How to choose the evaluation metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an enormous number of model evaluation metrics to choose from.  Given that choosing an evaluation metric is so important and there are tens or perhaps hundreds of metrics to choosefrom, what are you supposed to do?\n",
    "\n",
    "*The correct evaluation of learned models is one of the most important issues inpattern recognition.*—An Experimental Comparison Of Performance Measures For Classification, 2008.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the best approach is to talk to project stakeholders and figure out what is important about a model or set of predictions.  Then select a few metrics that seem to capture what is important, then test the metric with different scenarios.  A scenario might be a mock set of predictions for a test dataset with a skewed class distribution that matches your problem domain.  You can test what happens to the metric if a model predicts all the majority class, all the minority class, does well, does poorly, and so on.  A few small tests can rapidly help you get a feeling for how the metric might perform. Another approach might be to perform a literature review and discover what metrics are most commonly used by other practitioners or academics working on the same general type of problem.  This can often be insightful, but be warned that some fields of study may fall into groupthink and adopt a metric that might be excellent for comparing large numbers of models at scale, but terrible for model selection in practice.\n",
