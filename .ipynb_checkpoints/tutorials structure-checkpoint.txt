The tutorials are divided into six parts; they are:

Part 1:  Foundations.  Discover a gentle introduction to the field of imbalanced classification, the intuitions for skewed class distributions, and properties of datasets that makethese problems challenging.

Part 2:  Model Evaluation.  Discover the failure of classification accuracy for skewed class distributions and alternate performance metrics such as precision-recall, area under ROC curves, and probability scoring methods.

Part 3:  Data Sampling.  Discover techniques for transforming the training dataset to balance the class distribution, including data oversampling, undersampling, and combinations of these techniques.

Part 4:  Cost-Sensitive.  Discover modified versions of machine learning algorithms that allow different types of misclassification errors to have a different cost on model performance.

Part 5:  Advanced Algorithms.  Discover advanced algorithms for interpreting and calibrating  predicted  probabilities  for  imbalanced  classification,  as  well  as  the  use  of ensemble algorithms and techniques from the field of anomaly detection.

Part 6:  Projects.  Discover how to put the techniques from imbalanced classification into practice with end-to-end projects on real datasets that have skewed class distributions.
